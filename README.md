I have been playing around tweaking the **BotProfile.db** file with Counter Strike Source and I think I found the best balance for an average CS player, please feel free to edit it as you please and tweak it to your own liking.
<br><br>
If you don't know what this file does it basically changes the behaviour of bots you can make them as AIMBOT or as Dumb as you like.

# Installation Help
Put the BotProfile.db file in these locations;
<br>
<br>
**For Client's**
<br>
STEAM INSTALL DIR\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Source\cstrike\custom\cstrike\BotProfile.db
<br>
<br>
**For Dedicated Servers**
<br>
STEAM INSTALL DIR/Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Source Dedicated Server/cstrike/custom/cstrike/BotProfile.db
<br>
<br>
(You will need to create the cstrike folder in the custom folder, it will not be there by default)

# After Install
Set your Difficulty to Normal and play
